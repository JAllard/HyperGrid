//Merged all the connectors in so far

//TODO's

//DONE: the hypergrid linker in the GridService isn't hooked up yet, so nothing from there will work yet
//DONE: InstantMessageService != existing
//DONE: What the hell is the Helo stuff?
//HG friend handlers
//DONE: Adjusting the HG names is DEFINITELY broken, there's no way that we will do that in Aurora like it is in OpenSim
//DONE: Status updates in UserAgentService != existing
//Who cares: No HGLogin flag for OpenSim heh
//CacheCreators in UserManagementService is commented out!
//The UserManagementService doesn't really do anything yet since we don't implement the CreatorData stuff as of yet
//Who cares: No HGWorldMapModule, but who gives a crap? it doesn't do anything useful
//Adjust the creator data in HGInventoryService != working because of CreatorData
